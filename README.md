# Hey, I'm Gabby 👋🏽 &nbsp;`@GabbyCodes`

> *Still learning. Always building. Occasionally debugging at midnight.*

I'm a student developer and Computer Science major on a mission — to grow
into the kind of engineer who makes tech a little more diverse, a little more
inclusive, and a lot more interesting. As a Black woman in tech, I'm here to
take up space, write good code, and open doors for the people coming after me.
